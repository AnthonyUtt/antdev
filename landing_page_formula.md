# Landing Page Formula: A Reusable Checklist

## 1. **Value Proposition (Hero)**
- ✅ Clear, bold headline: *What you do + Who you do it for + Where/Why it matters.*  
- ✅ Subtext with tangible benefit or differentiation (*conversions, sales, growth*).  
- ✅ Primary CTA button above the fold (action-oriented).  
- ✅ Supporting visual (mockup, photo, illustration) that reflects service/product.  

**Goal:** Immediately communicate value and invite action.  

---

## 2. **Process / How It Works**
- ✅ Break service delivery into 3–5 easy steps.  
- ✅ Use simple icons or visuals for clarity.  
- ✅ Keep language approachable and jargon-free.  
- ✅ End with the outcome (*new website live, ready to convert customers*).  

**Goal:** Remove friction and reduce perceived complexity.  

---

## 3. **Reframe the Problem**
- ✅ Position your product/service as more than just a tool—make it a *growth driver*.  
- ✅ Educate users on missed opportunities without your solution.  
- ✅ Show strategy + execution (not just design, but sales funnels, conversions, etc.).  
- ✅ Use analogies or metaphors (e.g., “not just a business card, but the top of your sales funnel”).  

**Goal:** Shift perception from “optional expense” → “critical investment.”  

---

## 4. **Social Proof**
- ✅ Client testimonials with names, photos, and outcomes.  
- ✅ Highlight measurable results (traffic boost, conversions, revenue growth).  
- ✅ Use carousel or multiple quotes if possible.  
- ✅ Position testimonials after education section (once curiosity is built).  

**Goal:** Build trust and credibility through validation.  

---

## 5. **Secondary CTA (Conversion Reinforcement)**
- ✅ Reintroduce CTA after social proof.  
- ✅ Use stronger, more aspirational copy (*“Ready to supercharge your site?”*).  
- ✅ Ensure CTA language matches the hero CTA for consistency.  
- ✅ Place in a visually distinct container (colored background or box).  

**Goal:** Capture users who needed proof before committing.  

---

## 6. **Objection Handling (FAQs)**
- ✅ Address top 3–5 concerns:  
  - Who is this for?  
  - Timeline to delivery?  
  - Ongoing support?  
  - Price/cost expectations?  
- ✅ Use collapsible sections for scannability.  
- ✅ Keep answers concise, transparent, and reassuring.  

**Goal:** Remove last barriers to conversion.
