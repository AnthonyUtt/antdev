          <p>AntDev isn't a big agency. It's just me&mdash;Ant&mdash;based in Roanoke, Virginia, working directly with local businesses to build practical software.</p>
          <p>I'm a Senior Software Engineer at an AI startup by day, and I started AntDev because I wanted a way to do what I love&mdash;solving real problems with software&mdash;while building long-term relationships with people in my own community.</p>
          <p>If we work together, you're not dealing with a faceless company. You're working with a real person who cares about your business and wants you to feel good about the time and money you invest in technology.</p>

      <div class="[ about-story__content ] [ flow ]">
        <p>I've been taking things apart and putting them back together for as long as I can remember.</p>
        <p>As a kid, that meant an old Windows 95 PC with daughterboards scattered across the floor. In second grade, it meant following a tutorial to build an instant messaging "app" out of Windows scripts&mdash;and accidentally crashing half the computers in the school tech lab.</p>
        <p>In high school, I started learning real software development. In college, I studied IT and Computer Science. For the last decade, I've worked professionally as a developer across multiple web applications, and today I'm a Senior Software Engineer at a remote AI startup.</p>
        <p>Along the way, I've:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Built and maintained web apps used by real customers</li>
          <li>Designed automations to take repetitive work off people's plates</li>
          <li>Learned how to communicate clearly with non-technical stakeholders</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In 2021, I was recognized as one of BuiltIn's Tech Innovators, an award given to a small group of developers doing interesting work. I appreciated the recognition&mdash;but what really motivates me is much simpler: helping people fix broken processes and making their workday less painful.</p>

    <section class="[ about-why ]">
      <h2 class="[ about-why__title ]">why i started antdev</h2>
      <div class="[ about-why__content ] [ flow ]">
        <p>For a long time, I tried to "pick a niche" and follow the typical playbook: find a tiny vertical, do hard outbound sales, push people into using your thing.</p>
        <p>It never felt right.</p>
        <p>I don't want to treat local businesses as targets to extract value from. I'd rather bring value, build trust, and have clients walk away from a project thinking, "I'd happily work with Ant again."</p>
        <p>I like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fun, interesting problems</li>
          <li>Building software that actually gets used</li>
          <li>Working with people I enjoy talking to</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AntDev is my way of doing more of that&mdash;starting here in the Roanoke Valley.</p>

      <h2 class="[ about-expertise__title ]">what i do (and what i care about)</h2>
      <div class="[ about-expertise__content ]">
        <div class="[ about-expertise__services ]">
          <p>I specialize in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Web applications</strong> &ndash; Internal tools, dashboards, portals, and custom systems built around how your business really works.</li>
            <li><strong>Automations</strong> &ndash; Connecting the tools you already use so repetitive, boring work happens automatically instead of by hand.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Websites are part of what I offer, but my best work tends to be:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Custom software (greenfield or modernization)</li>
            <li>Cleaning up or rebuilding older "legacy" systems</li>
            <li>Stitching together tools so your team stops living in spreadsheets and email threads</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="[ about-expertise__values ]">
          <p>Underneath all of that, I care about:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Practical solutions</strong> &ndash; No bloated systems you'll never use.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear communication</strong> &ndash; Plain English, written plans, and frequent check-ins.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term relationships</strong> &ndash; I want you to feel comfortable calling me back, not burned by the last project.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If a client ever said, "Working with Ant is different because he cares and genuinely wants to help," I'd consider that a success.</p>

        <p>I've learned that the best projects aren't just about code&mdash;they're about collaboration.</p>
        <p>Here's what you can expect from me:</p>

      <div class="[ about-process__items ]">
        <div class="[ about-process__item ] [ card ]">
          <h3 class="[ card__title ]">Frequent, honest communication</h3>
          <div class="[ card__body ]">
            <p>I prefer to over-communicate. I'll write things up in detail before I start building, check in regularly, and make sure we're on the same page throughout the project.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="[ about-process__item ] [ card ]">
          <h3 class="[ card__title ]">A collaborative process</h3>
          <div class="[ card__body ]">
            <p>I do my best work with clients who are willing to talk openly about what's working, what isn't, and what they really need. Strong communication and honest feedback are non-negotiables for me.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="[ about-process__item ] [ card ]">
          <h3 class="[ card__title ]">A focus on fit</h3>
          <div class="[ card__body ]">
            <p>I'm not the right developer for every project, and that's okay. Part of the Discovery Session is figuring out whether I'm actually the right person to help.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="[ about-process__closing ]">If you like the idea of working with someone who will treat your business with care, ask a lot of questions, and give you straight answers&mdash;even if that means saying "you don't need custom software yet"&mdash;we'll probably get along.</p>

    <section class="[ about-personal ]">
      <h2 class="[ about-personal__title ]">a bit more about me</h2>
      <div class="[ about-personal__content ] [ flow ]">
        <p>When I'm not writing code, you'll usually find me:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Playing music</li>
          <li>Attending local events around Roanoke</li>
          <li>Tinkering with electronics and building things in the real world with my 3D printer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I mention this not because it directly affects your project, but because I think it's important to remember there's a real person on the other side of the screen. I'm not trying to be a "rockstar developer" or a hustle guru&mdash;I just enjoy solving problems and building useful things with good people.</p>

          We'll talk through your business, your current tools, and what's slowing you down. I'll ask questions, sketch out a few options, and give you an honest sense of what I'd do in your shoes&mdash;whether that's a website, automations, custom software, or even waiting until the time is right.

          30&ndash;45 minutes on Zoom or in person. No pressure, no obligation&mdash;just a conversation to see if working together makes sense.
