        <p>You'll walk me through your day-to-day operations, what's working well, and where things feel clunky or slow. I'll ask questions, take notes, and start thinking about what might actually help&mdash;whether that's a new website, some automation, custom software, or sometimes just a better way to use tools you already have.</p>
        <p>By the end, you'll have a clearer picture of your options&mdash;and I'll have a real understanding of your business, not just a sales checklist.</p>
