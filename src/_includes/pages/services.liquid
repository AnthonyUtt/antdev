        <p>Every business is at a different place with technology. Some just need a website that actually brings in customers. Others are buried in spreadsheets, email threads, and old systems no one wants to touch.</p>
        <p>I usually help in three main ways:</p>
        <ol class="[ services-hero__list ]">
          <li>Websites</li>
          <li>Business &amp; Workflow Automations</li>
          <li>Custom Software</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you're not sure which you need, that's normal&mdash;that's what the Discovery Session is for.</p>

        <h2 class="[ service-detail__title ]">websites that bring you customers (not just visitors)</h2>
      </div>
      {% include 'partials/components/note', text: "A solid website is often the foundation everything else builds on&mdash;it's where customers find you, learn to trust you, and decide to reach out." %}

        <div class="[ service-detail__description ] [ flow ]">
          <p>A lot of small-business websites are either out of date, hard to use, or built on DIY tools that are frustrating to maintain.</p>
          <p>Your website isn't just a business card&mdash;it's the top of your sales funnel. It's often the first interaction potential customers have with your brand, and it should do more than just sit there looking nice.</p>
          <p>A well-built site attracts the right visitors, keeps them engaged, and guides them toward taking action&mdash;whether that's scheduling a consultation, making a purchase, or signing up for your services.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="[ service-detail__features ]">
          <p>You get:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Custom design and development, tailored to your business</li>
            <li>A site that looks great on phones, tablets, and computers</li>
            <li>Clear messaging that explains what you do and who you serve</li>
            <li>Fast load times and a structure that's built to rank on Google</li>
            <li>Options for hosting and ongoing updates, so you're not stuck wrestling with it yourself</li>

      </div>
      {% include 'partials/components/note', text: "Automations can be a great starting point: they're often faster to implement than full custom software, and they can reveal where a deeper system or app would make the most sense." %}

        <div class="[ service-detail__description ] [ flow ]">
          <p>If your team is copying and pasting data between tools, forwarding the same emails over and over, or manually updating spreadsheets, there's probably a better way.</p>

            <li>Automatic reminders and follow-up emails for clients or staff</li>
            <li>Automated reporting and status updates for your team</li>
            <li>Syncing data between tools so you don't have to enter it twice</li>

      <div>
        <div class="[ service-detail__description ] [ flow ]">
          <p>Sometimes, off-the-shelf tools just don't fit. You've outgrown basic spreadsheets and generic apps, or you're stuck with a legacy system that no one wants to touch but everyone relies on.</p>
          <p>That's where custom software comes in.</p>
          <p>I design and build web applications that match how your business actually works, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Internal tools to manage projects, inventory, jobs, or workflows</li>
            <li>Customer portals and self-service dashboards</li>
            <li>Integrations that help systems "talk to each other" behind the scenes</li>
            <li>Modern replacements or extensions for older, hard-to-maintain systems</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="[ service-detail__features ]">
        <p>We'll start by understanding your current process&mdash;what's working, what isn't, and what a "good day" would look like for your team. From there, I'll design something that fits your real-world needs, not just what looks good on a sales demo.</p>
      </div>
      {% include 'partials/components/note', accent: true, noteTitle: "Good fit if:", text: "You have a legacy app, a homegrown system that's creaking under its own weight, or a complex process that off-the-shelf tools can't handle well." %}

          We'll spend 30&ndash;45 minutes talking through how your business works today and where things feel slow or clunky. I'll ask questions, sketch out a few options, and give you an honest sense of what I'd recommend.
