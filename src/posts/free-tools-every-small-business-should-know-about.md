You don't need to spend a fortune on software to run a small business well. There are genuinely good tools out there that cost nothing, or close to it.

These are tools I've personally used or recommended to clients. I'm not listing everything under the sun, just the ones that are actually worth your time. Every tool here either has a permanent free tier that's useful enough for most small businesses, or is completely free and open source.

## Website & Online Presence

If you have a website (and you should), these tools help you understand how it's performing and how people are finding you.

### Google Business Profile <img src="/assets/images/logo-minimal.svg" alt="AntDev logo" class="inline-logo">

If you serve a local area — whether that's Roanoke, the New River Valley, or anywhere else — this is non-negotiable. Your Google Business Profile is what shows up when someone searches for your business name or browses Google Maps. It's free, and it's often the first thing potential customers see. Keep it updated with your hours, photos, and contact info.

### Google Search Console <img src="/assets/images/logo-minimal.svg" alt="AntDev logo" class="inline-logo">

This tells you how your site appears in Google search results: what people are searching to find you, which pages show up, and whether Google is having trouble reading your site. It's not the most intuitive tool, but even a quick glance once a month can reveal problems you didn't know you had.

### PageSpeed Insights <img src="/assets/images/logo-minimal.svg" alt="AntDev logo" class="inline-logo">

Paste in your URL and get a detailed report on how fast your site loads, along with specific suggestions for improvement. Speed matters more than most people think. A slow site doesn't just frustrate visitors, it can hurt your search rankings too. I put together a [15-minute website audit](/posts/how-to-audit-your-website-in-15-minutes/) that walks you through checking this and more.

## Design & Content

You don't need a graphic designer on retainer to make things look professional. These tools get you surprisingly far.

### Canva

Canva is the go-to for creating social media graphics, flyers, business cards, presentations, and just about anything visual. The free tier includes thousands of templates and is more than enough for most small businesses. It won't replace a professional designer for everything, but it covers 80% of what you need.

### Unsplash <img src="/assets/images/logo-minimal.svg" alt="AntDev logo" class="inline-logo">

High-quality stock photography, completely free to use for commercial purposes. No attribution required, though it's nice to credit the photographer. When you need a professional-looking image for your website or social media, start here before paying for stock photos.

### Remove.bg

Upload a photo and it removes the background automatically. Great for product photos, headshots, or any image where you need a clean cutout. The free tier gives you lower-resolution downloads, which is usually fine for web use.

## Productivity & Organization

Once you have more than a couple of things to keep track of, you need something better than sticky notes and memory.

### Trello <img src="/assets/images/logo-minimal.svg" alt="AntDev logo" class="inline-logo">

A simple, visual way to manage tasks and projects. Think of it as a digital bulletin board with cards you can drag between columns. Great for tracking orders, managing a content calendar, or organizing any process with distinct stages. The free tier is generous enough for most small teams.

### Notion

Part notebook, part database, part project manager. Notion is more flexible than Trello but has a steeper learning curve. If you want one place to keep meeting notes, SOPs, task lists, and reference documents, it's hard to beat. The free plan works well for solo operators and small teams. Both Notion and Trello can be solid replacements if you've [outgrown your spreadsheets](/posts/the-hidden-costs-of-manual-data-entry/).

### Calendly

If you spend time going back and forth over email trying to schedule meetings, Calendly fixes that. You set your availability, share a link, and people book a time that works for both of you. The free tier gives you one event type, which is plenty if you just need a "Book a Call" link.

## Communication

Email works, but it's not always the best tool for every conversation.

### Slack <img src="/assets/images/logo-minimal.svg" alt="AntDev logo" class="inline-logo">

Organized team messaging with channels for different topics. Instead of long email threads, you get focused conversations that are easy to search later. The free tier limits your message history, but for small teams it's a huge step up from group texts and email chains.

### Loom <img src="/assets/images/logo-minimal.svg" alt="AntDev logo" class="inline-logo">

Record a quick video of your screen with your voice (and optionally your face). Perfect for explaining something that would take three paragraphs to write in an email. The free tier gives you 25 videos of up to 5 minutes each, which is enough for most business communication.

## Automation

These tools help you stop doing repetitive work by hand.

### Zapier <img src="/assets/images/logo-minimal.svg" alt="AntDev logo" class="inline-logo">

Zapier connects your tools together so that when something happens in one app, something else happens automatically. New form submission? Automatically add it to your spreadsheet and send a notification. New customer? Add them to your email list. The free tier gives you basic automations with limited runs per month, but it's enough to get started. If you're curious what's possible, I wrote about [simple automations you can set up without code](/posts/simple-automations-you-can-set-up-today-without-code/).

### Google Forms

Don't overlook this one. Google Forms is free, dead simple, and surprisingly powerful. Use it for customer intake forms, surveys, event RSVPs, or feedback collection. Responses go straight into a Google Sheet, which makes them easy to review and share.

## Analytics & Marketing

Understanding what's working (and what isn't) helps you spend your time and money wisely.

### Umami <img src="/assets/images/logo-minimal.svg" alt="AntDev logo" class="inline-logo">

A privacy-friendly, open-source alternative to Google Analytics. It tells you how many people visit your site, where they come from, and what pages they look at, without tracking your visitors across the web or requiring cookie banners. It's what I use on this site. Plausible is another good option in this space, and if you have a sense of humor, check out GoatCounter.

### Mailchimp <img src="/assets/images/logo-minimal.svg" alt="AntDev logo" class="inline-logo">

If you want to send email newsletters or marketing emails, Mailchimp's free tier lets you send to up to 500 contacts. It includes basic templates, audience management, and simple analytics. For most small businesses just getting started with email marketing, it's more than enough.

## What I'd Skip

Not every popular tool is worth your time. A couple I'd actively steer small businesses away from:

**Google Analytics.** I know, everyone uses it. But GA is major overkill for the vast majority of small business use cases. You don't need 34 different campaign trackers and an event on every element on your page. You need to see how many people visit your site, how long they stay, and whether they click on the things you want them to click on. That's it. A lightweight, privacy-focused tool like Umami or Plausible gives you exactly that without the complexity. And as people pay more attention to how much data companies collect about them, respecting your visitors' privacy is a good look.

**Heatmap and session replay tools** (Hotjar, LogRocket, etc.). These are built for optimizing every second of every visit to every corner of your site, often at the expense of performance — or your wallet. For a local business, that level of granularity is overkill. Worse, the scripts these tools inject can slow your site down enough to hurt your search rankings on Google. You'd be adding a tool to improve your site that actually makes it perform worse.

## How to Decide What You Actually Need

Don't try to adopt everything on this list at once. That's a recipe for tool fatigue and a bunch of accounts you never log into.

Instead, start with the problem:

- **"People can't find me online"** → Google Business Profile, Search Console
- **"I need to make graphics but can't afford a designer"** → Canva, Unsplash
- **"I'm drowning in tasks and can't keep track of anything"** → Trello or Notion
- **"I'm doing the same manual work every week"** → Zapier, Google Forms
- **"I don't know if my website is actually working"** → Umami, PageSpeed Insights

Pick one or two tools that address your biggest pain point. Get comfortable with those before adding more.

## When Free Isn't Enough

These tools will take you far, but there's usually a point where free tiers start to feel limiting. That's okay. It means your business is growing.

When that happens, you have two options: upgrade to a paid plan, or look into whether a custom solution would serve you better in the long run. Sometimes paying $20/month for a tool is the right call. Other times, you're better off investing in something built specifically for how your business works.
