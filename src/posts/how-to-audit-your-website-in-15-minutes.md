I look at small business websites around Roanoke all the time. It's one of the first things I do before reaching out to a potential client. And honestly, the two most common things I see are sites running on WordPress templates from 20 years ago and sites that clearly have never been tested on a phone.

The thing is, most business owners don't look at their own site the way a customer would. You built it (or had it built), you know what's on it, and you move on. But your visitors don't have that context.

This 15-minute audit won't catch everything, but it'll help you find the most common problems before your customers do. All you need is a browser and your phone.

## The First Impression Test (2 minutes)

Open your website on your phone. Not your laptop, your actual phone. This is how most people will see your site.

Ask yourself:

- Does everything load within a few seconds?
- Can you immediately tell what your business does?
- Is your main call-to-action visible without scrolling?

If your site takes more than 3-4 seconds to load on mobile, you're losing visitors. You can check your exact load time at [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) - just paste in your URL. That's one of many [free tools](/posts/free-tools-every-small-business-should-know-about/) that can help you understand how your site is performing.

## The "Can They Find You?" Check (3 minutes)

Open a private/incognito browser window and Google your business name. Look at what shows up:

- **Does your website appear?** It should be one of the first results for your exact business name.
- **What does the preview text say?** This is your page title and meta description. If it says something generic like "Home" or shows random text from your page, that's a missed opportunity.
- **Is your Google Business Profile showing?** If you have a physical location, your business info should appear on the right side of the results.

Click through to your site from Google. Does the page you land on match what the search result promised?

## The Broken Stuff Scan (3 minutes)

This is tedious but important. Click through your site like a visitor would:

- **Click every navigation link.** Do they all work? Do they go where you expect?
- **Test your contact form.** Actually fill it out and submit it. Did you receive the message? You'd be surprised how often contact forms silently break.
- **Look for missing images.** Scroll through your main pages and look for broken image icons or empty spaces where images should be.
- **Watch for redirect issues.** If clicking a link sends you somewhere unexpected, or if a page seems to hang and reload, you might have a redirect problem. I once worked with a client who had migrated their WordPress site and ended up with a handful of blog pages that all redirected to each other in an infinite loop. Nobody noticed for months because nobody was clicking those links.

If you find broken links or forms, fix them immediately. A broken contact form means potential customers are trying to reach you and can't.

## The Mobile Experience (3 minutes)

Still on your phone, try to actually use your site:

- **Tap the navigation menu.** Is it easy to open and close? Can you tap the links without accidentally hitting the wrong one?
- **Read a full page of text.** Is the font large enough? Do you have to zoom in or scroll sideways?
- **Try to tap a button.** Are buttons big enough to tap easily with your thumb?

If you find yourself pinching, zooming, or struggling to tap things, your mobile visitors are having the same experience. And they're probably leaving.

## The Trust Signals Review (2 minutes)

Small details matter. Check for:

- **Copyright year.** Scroll to the bottom. If it says 2019, visitors might wonder if you're still in business.
- **Testimonials or reviews.** Do you have any on your site? Can visitors see proof that other people have worked with you?
- **SSL certificate.** Look for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar. If visitors see "Not Secure" warnings, they're not going to trust you with their contact info.

## The Action Check (2 minutes)

Finally, pretend you're a potential customer who just landed on your site:

- **Is it clear what you want them to do?** Call you? Fill out a form? Visit your store?
- **Can they do it easily?** Your main call-to-action should be reachable within one or two clicks from any page.
- **Is your contact information on every page?** Or do visitors have to hunt for it?

## What to Do With Your Findings

If you found issues, prioritize them:

1. **Fix immediately:** Broken contact forms, broken links, SSL issues
2. **Fix this week:** Mobile usability problems, missing contact info
3. **Fix when you can:** Outdated copyright, missing testimonials, slow load times

## When to Call in Help

If your audit turned up a few issues, that's normal — most sites have something. But if you're failing multiple checks, or if the fixes are beyond what you're comfortable doing yourself, it might be worth having someone take a closer look. The goal isn't a perfect score; it's making sure your site isn't actively working against you. [Send me what you found](/contact/) and I'll tell you what's worth fixing first.
