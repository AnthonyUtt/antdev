postFaq:
  - question: "How can I tell if my website is bringing in customers?"
    answer: "Set up analytics to see what visitors actually do on your site. Look at where they're coming from, which pages they visit, and whether they're completing your calls-to-action. If you can't answer those questions with data, you're running on vibes."
  - question: "What's the first thing I should track on my website?"
    answer: "Start with basic analytics like Umami or Plausible to see visitor behavior, then set up Google Search Console to understand how people find you. Focus on tracking conversions — form submissions, phone clicks, or whatever action matters most to your business."
  - question: "Do I really need all that content on my website?"
    answer: "You need enough content to answer your ideal customer's questions and show them you know what you're doing. Too little content means Google has nothing to rank and visitors have no reason to trust you. Too much unfocused content dilutes your message and confuses people. Quality over quantity, always."
  - question: "What conversion rate should my small business website aim for?"
    answer: "Industry averages hover around 2-5% for small business websites, but the 'right' number depends on your traffic volume and what you're counting as a conversion. A site with 500 monthly visitors and a 3% conversion rate is generating 15 leads a month. If that's enough to keep you busy, great. If not, focus on driving more traffic before obsessing over the rate."

Most small business websites aren't broken. They're just not doing anything.

They load fine, they look decent enough, they've got a contact form buried on some page — and the owner assumes that's enough. I see this constantly around Roanoke and the surrounding area. Someone had a site built a few years ago, maybe paid a decent amount for it, and now it just... sits there. No website analytics. No conversion tracking. No idea whether a single customer has ever come from it. They're running on vibes.

That's not a website strategy. That's a coin flip.

## Two Patterns I Keep Seeing

Most small business websites I come across fall into one of two buckets.

The first is the "set it and forget it" site. Analytics never got set up. Google Search Console doesn't exist. The site went live and nobody looked at it again. One client I worked with had a site that'd been live for three years — no tracking whatsoever. They'd picked up some customers during that time and figured the website must have helped, but they couldn't tell me how many people visited, where they came from, or what they did once they got there. For all they knew, every single lead came from word of mouth and the site contributed nothing.

The second is the "everything and the kitchen sink" site. Every service, every product, every thought the owner has ever had, crammed into dropdown menus three layers deep. A potential client reached out to me once about a redesign — their existing site had something like 40 pages. When I asked who their ideal customer was and what they wanted that person to do on the site, they didn't have an answer. They just wanted everything on there, just in case.

Both approaches have the same problem: the website isn't being treated as a tool with a job. It's just a thing that exists.

## Your Website Isn't a Business Card

Some businesses treat their website like a digital business card. It shows you exist, lists what you do, and maybe has a contact form somewhere. That works if all you need is something to point people toward when they ask for your URL.

But if you want actual website lead generation — not just a page that exists — it needs to guide visitors toward taking action. That means being deliberate about what's on it and how it's structured.

When I build landing pages, I'm generally thinking about it in this order: lead with what you do and why someone should care, give context on who you help, show proof that other people trust you, and make the next step obvious. FAQs at the bottom to catch anyone who's still on the fence. It's not rocket science, but you'd be surprised how many sites skip half of these.

The clients who already have their content strategy figured out nod along when I walk them through this. The ones who haven't thought about content yet — usually the ones who are used to picking a WordPress theme and filling in the blanks — tend to wonder why we need content before we start designing. Because you can't design a tool until you know what job it's supposed to do.

## The 4K Photo Problem: When "Looking Good" Tanks Performance

A site came across my desk once that was getting absolutely dogwater mobile performance. Desktop rankings were fine, but mobile was a ghost town. The homepage hero image was a gorgeous, professional 4K photo — and it was absolutely massive. Visitors were bouncing before the page even finished loading.

When I explained that the image was tanking their mobile performance, the owner was genuinely shocked. They'd paid good money for that photo. They wanted it to look good. But "looking good" doesn't matter if nobody sticks around long enough to see it.

There are a hundred invisible details like this that can quietly kill your website performance — page speed, mobile usability, poorly optimized images, missing meta descriptions, weak calls-to-action. If you don't know to look for these things, you won't catch them. I wrote a [15-minute website audit checklist](/articles/how-to-audit-your-website-in-15-minutes/) that covers the most common ones.

## Getting the Content Balance Right

One of the most common mistakes I see is businesses getting the content balance wrong.

Too little content means Google has nothing to rank and visitors have no reason to trust you. You're not answering their questions, you're not demonstrating expertise — you're just saying "here's what we do, call us." That only works if someone already knows they want to hire you.

Too much unfocused content is just as bad. If you're trying to speak to everyone, you're speaking to no one. Your message gets diluted, your ideal customer can't tell if you're the right fit, and the people who do find you probably aren't the people you actually want to work with.

The goal is just enough content to speak directly to your ideal customer, answer their most pressing questions, and show that you know what you're doing. Quality over quantity.

I watched this click for a client in real time. Their first site was basically a portfolio — looked nice, but it wasn't built to generate leads. When they came back for a second project (a related business), they explicitly said they wanted the new site to be a lead generation tool, not a digital brochure. That shift changed everything about how we approached the build. Their contact form submissions went from maybe one a month to several a week. We're now in talks to refresh the original site with the same strategy.

## Website Analytics: You Can't Fix What You Can't See

If you're not tracking anything on your website, you're flying blind. You don't know what's working, what's not, where your visitors are coming from, or why they're leaving. You're making decisions based on gut feeling instead of data.

My recommendation for any business that's serious about their website: set up analytics first. Figure out what users are doing when they hit your site. Once you feel good about the user journey, set up Google Search Console and start working on getting more people to find you in the first place.

I'm not a fan of Google Analytics 4 for most small businesses. It's overkill — too many dashboards, too much noise. It makes you feel productive because you're looking at so much data, but most of it doesn't matter for a 10-person company. I prefer tools like [Umami](https://umami.is/) or [Plausible](https://plausible.io/). Privacy-respecting, straightforward, and they surface the information you actually need. I covered both in my [free tools post](/articles/free-tools-every-small-business-should-know-about/).

## How to Set Up Basic Website Tracking From Scratch

If you've got nothing set up right now, here's where to start:

1. **Pick an analytics tool.** I recommend [Umami](https://umami.is/) if you want to self-host it for free, or [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) if you'd rather they handle hosting. Both are privacy-friendly and won't overwhelm you with data you don't need.
2. **Add the tracking script.** You'll get a single snippet to paste into your site's `<head>`. WordPress has plugins for this; Squarespace and Wix have a "custom code" section in settings.
3. **Set up Google Search Console.** Verify your domain at [search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console) and submit your sitemap. This is how you find out what search terms people are actually using to land on your site.
4. **Figure out what counts as a conversion.** Form submission? Phone call? Whatever the main action is, make sure your analytics tool is tracking it. Umami and Plausible both support custom events for this.
5. **Check it once a week.** You don't need to live in your dashboard. Five minutes on Monday morning — traffic trends, top pages, conversion count — is plenty.

The whole setup takes maybe an hour. If you're already using [no-code automations](/articles/simple-automations-you-can-set-up-today-without-code/) for other parts of your business, this fits right into that workflow.

## What Website Metrics Actually Matter?

If you're just getting started with website conversion tracking, don't overcomplicate it. Focus on three things.

**Where are visitors coming from?** Google search, social media, direct traffic, referrals? If you're spending time on Instagram but all your traffic comes from Google, that's worth knowing. Go where the results are.

**What pages are they looking at?** Are they landing on your homepage and leaving immediately, or are they browsing your services page and reading your articles? This is how you figure out what's resonating — and what you can stop wasting time on.

**Are they actually taking action?** This is the one that matters. Are people filling out your contact form? Clicking your phone number? If the answer is no, something's off — either they can't find the CTA, they're not convinced, or there's friction in the process stopping them. That's your website conversion optimization starting point.

## When You Know, You Can Fix It

Once you have data, the fixes become obvious.

Visitors landing on your homepage and bouncing? Your value proposition might not be clear, or your page might be loading too slowly. Look at the [audit checklist](/articles/how-to-audit-your-website-in-15-minutes/) to rule out technical issues first.

People browsing multiple pages but never contacting you? Your CTA probably isn't obvious enough, or you're not building enough trust with social proof and testimonials.

Finding you through Google but on keywords you didn't expect? Your content strategy might need adjusting. Same idea as [tracking where your time actually goes](/articles/the-hidden-costs-of-manual-data-entry/) — the numbers tell a different story than your gut does.

None of this is fixable if you don't know it's happening. That's why the data matters.

## Stop Running on Vibes

If you're not paying attention to your website, you're leaving money on the table. You're paying for hosting, maybe paying for ads, definitely paying for the time you or your team spend maintaining the thing — and you have no idea if any of it is working.

You don't need to spend hours every week staring at dashboards. Set up the basics, check in weekly, and make decisions based on what's actually happening instead of what you hope is happening.

Your website should be working for you. If it's not — or if you're not sure — [let me take a look](/contact/).
